    "\n",
    "* Practice identifying and applying appropriate preprocessing steps\n",
    "* Perform an iterative modeling process, starting from a baseline model\n",
    "* Explore multiple model algorithms, and tune their hyperparameters\n",

    "\n",
    "Although you may be aware of some additional model algorithms available from scikit-learn, for this lab you will be focusing on two of them: k-nearest neighbors and decision trees. Here are some reminders about these models:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### kNN - [documentation here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm — unlike linear models or tree-based models — does not emphasize learning the relationship between the features and the target. Instead, for a given test record, it finds the most similar records in the training set and returns an average of their target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training speed:** Fast. In theory it's just saving the training data for later, although the scikit-learn implementation has some additional logic \"under the hood\" to make prediction faster.\n",
    "* **Prediction speed:** Very slow. The model has to look at every record in the training set to find the k closest to the new record.\n",
    "* **Requires scaling:** Yes. The algorithm to find the nearest records is distance-based, so it matters that distances are all on the same scale.\n",
    "* **Key hyperparameters:** `n_neighbors` (how many nearest neighbors to find; too few neighbors leads to overfitting, too many leads to underfitting), `p` and `metric` (what kind of distance to use in defining \"nearest\" neighbors)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Trees - [documentation here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to linear models (and unlike kNN), this algorithm emphasizes learning the relationship between the features and the target. However, unlike a linear model that tries to find linear relationships between each of the features and the target, decision trees look for ways to split the data based on features to decrease the entropy of the target in each split.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training speed:** Slow. The model is considering splits based on as many as all of the available features, and it can split on the same feature multiple times. This requires exponential computational time that increases based on the number of columns as well as the number of rows.\n",
    "* **Prediction speed:** Medium fast. Producing a prediction with a decision tree means applying several conditional statements, which is slower than something like logistic regression but faster than kNN.\n",
    "* **Requires scaling:** No. This model is not distance-based. You also can use a `LabelEncoder` rather than `OneHotEncoder` for categorical data, since this algorithm doesn't necessarily assume that the distance between `1` and `2` is the same as the distance between `2` and `3`.\n",
    "* **Key hyperparameters:** Many features relating to \"pruning\" the tree. By default they are set so the tree can overfit, and by setting them higher or lower (depending on the hyperparameter) you can reduce overfitting, but too much will lead to underfitting. These are: `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`, `min_weight_fraction_leaf`, `max_features`, `max_leaf_nodes`, and `min_impurity_decrease`. You can also try changing the `criterion` to \"entropy\" or the `splitter` to \"random\" if you want to change the splitting logic."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you practiced the end-to-end machine learning process with multiple model algorithms, including tuning the hyperparameters for those different algorithms. You saw how nonparametric models can be more flexible than linear models, potentially leading to overfitting but also potentially reducing underfitting by being able to learn non-linear relationships between variables. You also likely saw how there can be a tradeoff between speed and performance, with good metrics correlating with slow speeds."
